# Q16 Add Two Numbers

12/16 p221 Q2

## Q

You are given two __non-empty__ linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in __reverse order__, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Sample Input

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68508521/146377788-04479890-b18b-4a64-8e79-5ea9ec556ff9.png)

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]  
Output: [7,0,8]  
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.  

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]  
Output: [0]  

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]  
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
