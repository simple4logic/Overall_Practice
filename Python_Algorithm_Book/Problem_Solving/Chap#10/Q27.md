# Q27 Merge k Sorted Lists

01/17 p274 Q27

## Q

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.  

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.  

## Sample Input 

__Input__: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]  
__Output__: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]  
__Explanation__: The linked-lists are:  
[  
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6  
]  
merging them into one sorted list:  
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

__Input__: lists = []  
__Output__: []  

__Input__: lists = [[ ]]  
__Output__: []  

## Constraints

- k == lists.length
- 0 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= lists[i][j] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- lists[i] is sorted in __ascending order__.
- The sum of lists[i].length won't exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.


## 1. My Solution =~ Given Solution

```py
class Node():
    def __init__(self, val = 0, next = None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution():
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Node]) -> Node:
        root = result = Node(None) #save result's address at root
        heap = []

        for i in range(len(lists)):
            if lists[i]:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))
        
        while heap:
            node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            idx = node[1]
            result.next = node[2]

            result = result.next
            if result.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (result.next.val, idx, result.next))

        return root.next
```

Input list, lists = [[1,2,4], [3,4,5], [2,4,7]] is given as __LINKED-LIST__. It is like [node(val=1, points 2), node(val=3, points 4), node(val=3, points 4)]. Don't be confused by the input.  

By the way, let's continue with the example above. len = 3, so i = 0, 1, 2. See the case when i = 0. lists[0] is node(val = 1, points 2), so it is the address. Namely this is not zero, then executes if. Push the tuple (val, idx, node address) to the heap(list). Repeat k(length of the array) times.  

Loop until heap array is empty. Node that poped out first is the MINIMUM NODE that has the smallest value(*because tuple's first element is the value of the node, so searching is done depend on the value size).
