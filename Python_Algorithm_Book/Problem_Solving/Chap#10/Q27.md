# Q27 Merge k Sorted Lists

01/17 p274 Q27

## Q

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.  

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.  

## Sample Input 

__Input__: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]  
__Output__: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]  
__Explanation__: The linked-lists are:  
[  
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6  
]  
merging them into one sorted list:  
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

__Input__: lists = []  
__Output__: []  

__Input__: lists = [[ ]]  
__Output__: []  

## Constraints

- k == lists.length
- 0 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= lists[i][j] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- lists[i] is sorted in __ascending order__.
- The sum of lists[i].length won't exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.


## 1. My Solution =~ Given Solution

```py
class Node():
    def __init__(self, val = 0, next = None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution():
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Node]) -> Node:
        root = result = Node(None) #save result's address at root
        heap = []

        for i in range(len(lists)):
            if lists[i]:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))
        
        while heap:
            node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            idx = node[1]
            result.next = node[2]

            result = result.next
            if result.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (result.next.val, idx, result.next))

        return root.next
```
