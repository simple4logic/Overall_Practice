# Q18 Odd Even Linked List

12/19 p233 Q328

## Q

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.  

The __first__ node is considered __odd__, and the __second__ node is __even__, and so on.  

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.  

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.  

## Sample Input

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68508521/146664857-2572d55f-3857-4e54-9a8d-4a86836fd6f9.png)  

Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]  
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

## Constraints
- n == number of nodes in the linked list
- 0 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>6</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>6</sup>


## 1. My own Solution

```py
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


```
```py
#to test, you have to make to linked-list manually. 
inp1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
def makeLinkedList(inp: List) -> ListNode: 
    #function that create linked-list from the list
    node = ListNode()
    head = node
    for val in inp:
        new_node = ListNode(val)
        new_node.next = node.next
        node.next = new_node
        node = node.next
    return head

link1 = makeLinkedList(inp1).next

#for test
a = Solution()
head_node = a.swapPairs(link1)
while head_node:
    print(head_node.val)
    head_node = head_node.next
```
