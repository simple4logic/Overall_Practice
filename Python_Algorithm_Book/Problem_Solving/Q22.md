## Q

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `ith` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

## Sample Input 

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]  
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]  
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]  
Output: [1,1,0]

## Constraints

- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
