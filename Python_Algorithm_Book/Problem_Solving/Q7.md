# Q7 two-sum

11/24 p173

## Q
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to _target_.

You may assume that each input would have __exactly one solution__, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Sample Input
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]  

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]  

## Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- __Only one valid answer exists.__

## 1. My Solution == Given solution #1
```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                if (nums[i]+nums[j])==target:
                        return [i, j]

#for testing
a = Solution()
nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
print(a.twoSum(nums, target))
```
[Brute Force]  
My answer is by using brute force. Skip additional commentary. (Book answer is also same as mine.)

## 2. Given Solution #2
```py
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - n

        if complement in nums[i+1:]:
            return [nums.index(n), nums[i+1:].index(complement)+(i+1)]
```

[Brute Force]  
This method derived from brute force. Just changed from "double for-loop" to "searching by in" algorithm. Still Big O(time complexity) is n^2, but it takes significantly less time than just using brute force. That's because using "in" is much faster than comparing each element.

## 3. Given Solution #3
```py
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    nums_map = {}
    #change key&value, then save it to the dictionary
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        nums_map[num]=i #key is num itself, and value is idx.

    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums): #just nums_map(dict name) = key returns.
        #check whether target-num in dict keys & filter if it is double-used (by checking "i")
        if target-num in nums_map and i != nums_map[target-num]:
            return [i, nums_map[target-num]]
```

[Using "in"]  
This method changed little bit from before. In for loop(variable = X), search target-X in dict key. Of course repeated usage of number should be prevented(by i != nums_map[target-num]). This method's Big O is generally O(1) (In worst case, O(n)). So, you can that much better algo than before.

## 4. Given Solution #4
```py
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    nums_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target-num in nums_map:
            return [nums_map[target-num], i]
        nums_map[num] = i
```

Almost same as given sol #3, but code is cleaned up. Shorten than before. #3 saves all value to dict, but this can escape earlier when it finds solution.
